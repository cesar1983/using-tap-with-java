	<title>Diagnostics in TAP with YAML</title>
	
	<para>In TAP it is very easy to see whether a test passed or failed, but 
	sometimes you want more information, like adding a stack trace, the raw test, 
	expected and got values or a base64 file content. This extra information is 
	called diagnostics.  
	</para>
	
	<example>
		<title>YAMLish diagnostics in TAP</title>
		<programlisting linenumbering="numbered" language="TAP"><![CDATA[1..3
ok 1
not ok 2
   ---
   expected: 1
   got: 2
   file: sample.MyFirstTest.java
   ...
ok 3 # SKIP
]]></programlisting>
	</example>
	
	<para>The example above gives you an example of diagnostics in TAP. The 
	syntax is called YAMLish. YAML is <quote><author><orgname>YAML.org
	</orgname></author>a human friendly data serialization standard for all 
	programming languages</quote>. It is an acronym for YAML Aint' Markup 
	Language, although some may think it means Yet Another Marlup Language.</para>
	
	
	<para>As you can see you just have to enclose YAML between '---' and 
	'...', then you add each property followed by a ':' and the property's 
	value. Each YAML is linked to the Test Result above it. In example 1 
	the YAML contains the diagnostic information of the 'not ok 2' Test Result.</para>
