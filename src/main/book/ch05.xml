	<title>TestNG and TAP</title>
	
	<para>TestNG was created by CÃ©dric Beust as test framework to fill the 
	gaps left by JUnit. One of these gaps was extensibility. In tap4j there is 
	a Listener responsible for creating a TAP Stream for a Test Result.</para>
	
	<para>Say you have a test project with over two hundreds tests and would 
	like to have your test results outputted in TAP. I you will have to do 
	is add a listener to your suite of tests. Let's see some examples that 
	may help making it clear.</para>
