	<title>Where is TAP being used?</title>
	
	<para>As mentioned in Chapter 1, TAP was created within the Perl community 
	and is thus used by many Perl programmers as default output format for their 
	tests. However TAP was later ported for PHP, Python, C, C++, Shell, Ruby, 
	Java, Lua, among other programming languages.</para>
	
	<para>The Jenkins TestLink Plug-in is a consumer of TAP Streams. This 
	plug-in executes automated tests integrated with TestLink and reads the 
	test results (files with TAP Streams) and uploads test results back 
	to TestLink.</para>
